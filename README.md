# Django_Blog_Project
Blog Web Application Using Python Django

The aim behind developing this Blog Application is to get good understanding of Django Framework. This application allow users to register and create their own blogs, update & delete them. Thus, implementing the CRUD operations.
This project helped me to understand the MVT architecture and ORM ( object relational mapper ) concept of databases. This complete application is developed by me from scratch to the 
deployment on Heroku Server. 

**Skills Utilized :**

* **Back-End**  : Python Django  
* **Database**  : SQLite

* **Tools**     : VS Code
